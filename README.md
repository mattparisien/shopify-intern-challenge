# Prompt it!

Prompt it! is a mini application built with React and TailwindCSS which allows visitors to enter a prompt and receive a response. The app uses OpenAI's API, more specifically its GPT-3 engine, to configure a valid response for the query.

Built as part of Shopify's front-end development intern challenge.
